	On a high level, my project is a circuit lab in which students can build a circuit using a series of circuit forming a ground to ground connection. The actual circuit solver did not require any other modules than Tkinter and math, both of which are built in modules of the Python library. However, the transient analysis portion of the project did require me to utilize numpy and matplotlib, both of which are external modules. Here, I will go over instructions to install numpy and matplotlib.
One way to install these modules is to use scipy, which is a package that contains both numpy and matplotlib. Here are the instructions to install numpy and then scipy:
If you have a PC, do the following commands on command prompt. Make sure your command prompt recognizes Python:
- Python –m easy_install numpy
- Python –m easy_install scipy
For macs, just do the following:
- python3 –m easy_install numpy
- python 3 –m easy_install scipy
If the following doesn’t work, install pip from online and do “pip install” instead of “easy_install”.
